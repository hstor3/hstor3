### Hi, I'm Heather Storseth ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer and am currently located in Holland, Michigan.

I enjoy creating modern, user friendly websites and want to help progressive oriented companies improve their businesses.

As a jack of all trades, I thoroughly enjoy learning new things, especially testing out the niches and tricks of the different languages.
